# Loan-Approval-Machine-Learning

Economic growth is accelerated by consumers having the ability to borrow. It is a balancing act between allowing credit worthy consumers to borrow and rates that provide a return to the bank.  This balancing act becomes essential for a healthy economy. 

If consumers default on the loan (donâ€™t pay back the full amount of the loan contract) banks projected revenue decreases and may lead to unstable profitability. This could have a negative impact on the economy due to less credit available for consumers. The ability to predict loan success is important for the bank revenue projections and could also be an indicator of a shrinking economy.

This project dives into these questions and identifies some interesting correlations. See "Second Capstone Report" for a summary of all insights and methods used.
